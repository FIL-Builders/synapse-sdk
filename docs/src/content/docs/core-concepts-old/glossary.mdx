This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Filecoin On-Chain Cloud documentation.

## Core Concepts

### Data Set

A logical container of pieces managed by a storage provider for a client. Each data set:

- Has a unique ID
- Is managed by one storage provider
- Contains one or more pieces
- Has associated proof verification schedules
- Is tracked on-chain by the PDPVerifier contract

See: [PDP Overview](/core-concepts/pdp-overview)

### Piece

A unit of data stored in a data set. Each piece:

- Has a unique PieceCID (content identifier)
- Is typically 127 bytes to several GB
- Has a Merkle tree representation for proofs
- Is tracked on-chain with metadata
- Can be downloaded independently

### PieceCID

Content Identifier for a piece. This is:

- The Merkle root hash of the piece data
- Used to verify piece integrity
- How pieces are referenced for downloads
- Immutable (same data = same CID)

## Proof System

### PDP (Proof of Data Possession)

A cryptographic protocol that allows storage providers to prove they possess data without revealing the data itself. Key properties:

- Uses Merkle tree proofs
- Challenges are randomized and unpredictable
- Verification happens on-chain
- Efficient (small proofs for large data)

See: [PDP Overview](/core-concepts/pdp-overview)

### PDPVerifier Contract

The smart contract that manages proof verification. Responsibilities:

- Creates and manages data sets
- Generates randomized challenges
- Verifies Merkle proofs
- Reports faults to listener contracts
- Neutral layer (no business logic)

See: [System Architecture](/core-concepts/architecture)

### Challenge

A randomized request for proof that a provider possesses specific data. Challenges:

- Are generated using drand randomness
- Cannot be predicted in advance
- Specify which leaf to prove
- Have a time window for response
- Trigger faults if not answered

### Merkle Proof

A cryptographic proof that a specific piece of data exists in a Merkle tree. Contains:

- The leaf data being proven
- Sibling hashes along the path to root
- Path indices (left/right decisions)
- Compact size (O(log n) where n = leaf count)

### Proving Period

The time interval between required proofs for a data set. Measured in:

- Filecoin epochs (30 seconds each)
- Configured per data set
- Typically ranges from hours to days
- Determines proof frequency

## Payment System

### FilecoinPay V1

The smart contract system for automated payments. Provides:

- Payment rails (automated channels)
- Lockup mechanism (provider protection)
- Operator approvals
- Settlement functions
- ERC-20 token support

See: [FilecoinPay Technical Overview](/core-concepts/filecoin-pay-overview)

### Payment Rail

An automated payment channel from payer to payee. Characteristics:

- One-to-one relationship (specific payer → specific payee)
- Has a payment rate (tokens per epoch)
- Has a lockup period (guarantee window)
- Managed by an operator contract
- Can have optional validator

### Lockup

Funds reserved to guarantee provider payment. Two types:

- **Streaming lockup**: `paymentRate × lockupPeriod`
- **Fixed lockup**: One-time payment pool

Purpose:

- Ensures providers get paid even if client abandons account
- Acts as minimum balance requirement
- Activated after rail termination (safety hatch)

### Epoch

A unit of time in the Filecoin network, approximately 30 seconds. Used for:

- Payment rate calculations (e.g., 3 USDFC per epoch)
- Proof challenge timing
- Lockup period specifications
- Settlement calculations

### Operator

A trusted smart contract that manages payment rails on behalf of payers. Examples:

- FilecoinWarmStorageService contract
- Future: Compute service contracts

Capabilities:

- Create payment rails
- Modify rail terms
- Settle payments
- Terminate rails

Constraints:

- Must be approved by payer
- Subject to allowance limits

### Validator

An optional arbitrator contract that can mediate payments. Capabilities:

- Adjust settlement amounts
- Veto rail terminations
- Apply penalties for poor service quality
- Enforce custom SLAs

Currently not used in WarmStorage, but available for future implementations.

## Service Layer

### WarmStorage / FilecoinWarmStorageService

The business logic contract for the storage marketplace. Responsibilities:

- Client authentication via EIP-712 signatures
- Payment rail creation and management
- Metadata storage
- Integration with PDP and FilecoinPay
- Pricing calculations

See: [Warm Storage Overview](/core-concepts/fwss-overview)

### PDPListener

An interface that storage services implement to receive callbacks from PDPVerifier. Callbacks:

- `dataSetCreated` - New data set initialized
- `piecesAdded` - Pieces added to data set
- `possessionProven` - Successful proof submitted
- `nextProvingPeriod` - Proof failed or period advanced

Enables custom business logic in response to proof events.

### Record Keeper

The contract address that receives PDPListener callbacks for a data set. Typically:

- The WarmStorage contract address
- Set when creating the data set
- Cannot be changed after creation
- Receives all lifecycle events

## SDK Components

:::note
These are **SDK components** (TypeScript classes), not smart contracts.
:::

### Synapse

The main SDK entry point. Provides:

- Factory pattern initialization (`Synapse.create()`)
- Network detection
- Component orchestration
- High-level API (`synapse.storage.upload()`)

### PaymentsService

SDK client for the FilecoinPay V1 contract. Handles:

- USDFC deposits and withdrawals
- Service operator approvals
- Payment rail queries
- Account balance management

### StorageManager

High-level SDK component for storage operations. Features:

- Auto provider selection
- Simple upload/download API
- Context caching
- Provider-agnostic downloads

### StorageContext

SDK component representing a connection to a specific provider. Manages:

- Provider-specific operations
- Data set lifecycle
- Upload/download to one provider
- Piece status queries

## Filecoin Network

### Drand

A distributed randomness beacon used for unpredictable challenge generation. Properties:

- Publicly verifiable randomness
- Cannot be predicted or manipulated
- Used by Filecoin network
- Accessed via beacon contract on-chain

### Curio

The storage provider software that manages:

- Data storage
- Proof generation and submission
- API endpoints for clients
- Integration with blockchain

### EIP-712

Ethereum standard for typed structured data signing. Used for:

- Client authentication in WarmStorage
- CreateDataSet operations
- AddPieces operations
- Secure, user-friendly signatures

## Tokens

### USDFC

USD-pegged stablecoin used for payments in the system. Properties:

- ERC-20 token
- 18 decimal places
- Used for deposits, payments, lockups
- Supported by FilecoinPay V1

### FIL

Native Filecoin token. Notes:

- Can be used for gas fees
- Not currently used for storage payments (USDFC is used)
- Network native token
