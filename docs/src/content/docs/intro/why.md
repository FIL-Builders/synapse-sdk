Traditional cloud storage solutions present several challenges:

- **Centralized Control**: Data and services are controlled by a single provider
- **Limited Transparency**: Operations and pricing are opaque
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Difficult to migrate between providers
- **Trust Requirements**: Users must trust providers to handle data properly
- **Fixed Payment Models**: Inflexible billing tied to specific providers

## The FOC Solution

Traditional cloud services offer performance and usability but lack transparency, auditability, and user ownership. **Filecoin Onchain Cloud** bridges this gap by introducing a **trustless execution layer** for decentralized services. Each service in the Onchain Cloud â€” from storage to payment â€” operates as a smart contract, ensuring that every action, transaction, and proof is **verifiable on the Filecoin blockchain**.

FOC is designed to:
- âœ… **Enable hot and verifiable data storage and retrieval** with Proof of Data Possession (PDP) & Filecoin Beam
- ðŸ’° **Power programmable payments** via Filecoin Pay â€” a token-agnostic payment rail for decentralized services
- ðŸ§© **Simplify developer integration** through the Synapse SDK â€” a TypeScript library for building Filecoin-native dApps
- ðŸ’» **Provide programmable services** â€” Smart contract-based, composable service primitives on top of the Filecoin network
- ðŸš€ **Foster innovation** by letting teams build, fork, and combine services into new decentralized applications

### Key Differentiators

| Feature | Traditional Cloud | Filecoin Onchain Cloud |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| Data Control | Provider controlled | User owned |
| Transparency | Limited | Full blockchain verification |
| Programmability | Provider APIs | Smart contracts |
| Payment Models | Fixed | Flexible & programmable |
| Trust Model | Provider trust | Cryptographic proofs |
| Vendor Lock-in | High | None |

### Use Cases

Filecoin Onchain Cloud opens the door for new classes of verifiable applications:

- Decentralized data storage and pinning platforms (e.g., Filecoin Pin)
- AI and compute services tied to verifiable data pipelines
- Autonomous agents that own, store, and pay for their data
- Regulatory-compliant archiving systems with proof-of-retention
- Data DAOs and programmable marketplaces for shared datasets

By unifying data, payments, and verifiability, FOC provides the foundation for the next generation of decentralized applications â€” where storage is not just a service, but a verifiable primitive.

## Getting Started
