## What is Filecoin On-Chain Cloud?

Filecoin On-Chain Cloud is a **smart-contract marketplace for decentralized storage services** built on the Filecoin network. It enables developers to build applications that store and verify data on Filecoin while giving them the opportunity to build their own storage services.

### At a Glance

- **Three-layer architecture**: Protocol (PDP) → Infrastructure (Payments) → Application (Storage)
- **Cryptographic verification**: Providers prove data possession without revealing data
- **Automated payments**: Smart contract rails with lockup guarantees
- **Developer SDK**: TypeScript library abstracts all complexity
- **On-chain verification**: All proofs verified by smart contracts
- **Fault tolerance**: Payment adjustments when proofs fail

The system provides:

- **Provable storage** through cryptographic verification (PDP)
- **Automated payments** via smart contract payment rails
- **Programmable services** through smart contract-based service primitives
- **Developer-friendly SDK** with TypeScript interfaces

## System Architecture

The Filecoin On-Chain Cloud system consists of three smart contracts working together on Filecoin EVM.

### Proof of Data Possession (PDP)

PDP is a cryptographic protocol that allows storage providers to prove they possess your data **without revealing the data itself**. The system uses randomized challenges and Merkle proofs to verify storage continuously, with all verification happening on-chain.

**Key benefits:**

- Cryptographically verifiable storage
- Small proofs for large data
- Continuous verification (not one-time)

### Payment Rails and Lockup

Payment rails are **automated payment channels** that stream tokens from clients to providers at a specified rate (e.g., 100 USDFC/epoch). The lockup mechanism ensures providers get paid even if clients abandon their accounts by reserving funds for a guaranteed period.

### Warm Storage

Warm Storage is the **business logic layer** that combines PDP verification with payment rails. It handles client authentication, payment coordination, pricing, metadata management, and fault handling.

Service providers run Curio nodes that store data, submit proofs, and provide HTTP APIs for upload/download.
