## General Questions

---

### What is Filecoin Onchain Cloud?

Filecoin Onchain Cloud is a smart-contract marketplace for decentralized storage services built on the Filecoin network. It allows developers to store and retrieve data on Filecoin using a simple TypeScript SDK, with all storage agreements and payments managed by smart contracts.

### How does Filecoin Onchain Cloud work?

Filecoin Onchain Cloud works by using a combination of smart contracts and decentralized storage to provide a secure and reliable storage solution.

### How do I get started with Filecoin Onchain Cloud?

You can get started with Filecoin Onchain Cloud by using the [Synapse SDK](/getting-started/).

## PDP Questions

---

### How often are proofs required?

Every 30 minutes to 24 hours (configurable). Typical production: once per day.

### What happens if my provider goes offline?

Fault is reported on-chain. You're protected by the lockup period—typically 30 days of guaranteed payment coverage. Provider can recover by coming back online.

### How much does verification cost?

~$0.05-0.20 per proof in gas fees. Provider pays this, factored into storage pricing.

### Can I verify proofs myself?

Yes! All proofs are public on-chain. You can independently verify using the PDPVerifier contract.

### How often are proofs required?

Depends on the `challengeDelay` parameter. Typical values:

- Testing: Every 60 epochs (~30 minutes)
- Production: Every 2,880 epochs (~1 day)

### What happens if provider goes offline?

- If offline during challenge window → fault reported
- Provider can call `nextProvingPeriod()` to acknowledge
- Fault may trigger payment adjustments
- Provider can recover by coming back online

### Can clients verify proofs themselves?

Yes! Proofs are public on-chain:

- Read proof events from PDPVerifier
- Recompute Merkle verification
- Independent verification possible

### How much does it cost to store data?

Gas costs for PDP operations:

- One-time: `createDataSet` (~$0.10-1)
- Per piece: `addPieces` (~$0.05-0.5 per piece)
- Ongoing: `provePieces` (~$0.05-0.2 per proof)
- Plus storage provider's fees (see pricing)

### What prevents providers from cheating?

Multiple protections:

- **Unpredictable challenges**: Cannot predict which data will be checked
- **Cryptographic proofs**: Cannot fake without actual data
- **Frequent challenges**: Must maintain data continuously
- **Economic incentives**: Faults affect reputation and payments
